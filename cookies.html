            <p class="sub2">wow i really like cookies</p>
              <p class="sub1">New York City</p>
              <p class="description1">
              <b>Milk and Cookies</b>: so far, my favorite ever - soft, sweet, slightly chewy and very chocolatey. This bakery also makes other delectable bakes like their ridiculously chocolatey brownie
              <br>
              <b>Baked</b>: although this cookie looks good on the outside, I found the texture to be a little too dry and hard for my liking
              <br>
              <b>Levain</b>: world famous and delectable, but not my personal favorite because of the slightly unconventional shape, baking style, and ultimately texture. Also who really goes to midtown all the time
              <br>
              <b>Jacques Torres</b>: a king of kings, beautifully chocolatey, crunchy yet fudgy, and actually enormous. JT will always be my man - don’t miss the mudslide cookie too
              <br>
              <b>Insomnia</b>: a classic and my go-to on a windy winter’s night - reliably fast, warm, and gooey
              <br>
              <b>Max Brenner</b>: potentially one of the worst cookies I’ve ever had in NYC - hard, lacking chocolate, and boring
              <br>
              <b>Rubyzaar Baked</b>: a hidden gem only to be found in Williamsburg on weekends - a gorgeous array of carefully crafted cookies, but the winner in my heart was the Classic Rock for its hearty chocolate chunks and tasteful sprinkle of rock salt
              <br>
              <b>Starbucks</b>: not mind-blowing, but pretty fine for a sugar addict’s morning pick-me-up since it is ALWAYS there. Alternatively, just down with coffee
              <br>
              <b>Schmackary’s</b>: very sweet, yet very beautiful. Fudgy, soft, and rich but a little too sweet for my liking- which says a lot from someone who is actually addicted to sugar
              <br>
              <b>Dominique Ansel</b>: not a cookie, but almost - the cookie shot is filled to the brim with warm milk and is marvellous just to look at. Very fun, but not your everyday cookie - esp. w/ the consistently long lines
              <br>
              <b>Momofuku Milk Bar</b>: in spite world acclaim, don’t come here for the cookie - stick to the icecream
              <br>
              <b>La Colombe</b>: gluten free (if that matters), and almost everywhere around the city. A little crunchier than most - for those who like their fries crispy
              <br>
              <b>Alamo Drafthouse Cinema</b>: really cool, mainly because warm cookies were served to us in a theater as we were watching a movie, but also warm and dense and fragrant
              <br>
              <b>Balthazar Bakery</b>: chewy, chocolatey and pleasant, but not the city’s most memorable cookie
              <br>
              <b>By CHLOE</b>: these vegan cookies are larger than the size of an average human head and are sprinkled all over with chocolate, which is awesome, but just a little too crunchy and thin for my liking
