            <p class="sub2">wow i really like cookies</p>
              <p class="sub1">New York City</p>
              <p class="description1">
              <b>Milk and Cookies</b>: so far, my favorite ever - soft, sweet, slightly chewy and very chocolatey. Milk and Cookies also churns out other delectable bakes like their ridiculously chocolatey brownie!
              <br>
              <b>Baked</b>: though this cookie looks great on the outside, I personally found its texture to be a little dry and hard
              <br>
              <b>Levain</b>: world famous and delectable, but not my personal favorite because of its slightly unconventional shape, baking process, and ultimately texture. Also who really goes to Midtown all the time?
              <br>
              <b>Jacques Torres</b>: a king of kings, beautifully chocolatey, crunchy yet fudgy, and actually enormous. JT will always be my man - don’t miss the Mudslide cookie too!
              <br>
              <b>Insomnia</b>: a classic and my go-to on a windy winter’s night - reliably fast, warm, and gooey
              <br>
              <b>Max Brenner</b>: reliably a palace of chocolate, but sadly home to one of the worst chocolate chip cookies I’ve had in NYC - hard and stale, lacking chocolate, and boring
              <br>
              <b>Rubyzaar Baked</b>: a hidden gem only to be found in Williamsburg on weekends - a gorgeous array of carefully crafted cookies, but the winner in my heart was the Classic Rock for its hearty chocolate chunks and tasteful sprinkle of rock salt
              <br>
              <b>Starbucks</b>: not mind-blowing, but pretty fine for a sugar addict’s morning pick-me-up since it is actually ALWAYS there. Alternatively, just down with coffee
              <br>
              <b>Schmackary’s</b>: very sweet, yet very beautiful. Fudgy, soft, and rich but go easy on portions because these cookies will sugar you out <b>fast</b>
              <br>
              <b>Dominique Ansel</b>: not a cookie, but almost - the cookie shot is filled to the brim with warm milk and is marvellous just to look at. Very fun, but not your everyday cookie - esp. w/ DA's consistently long lines
              <br>
              <b>Momofuku Milk Bar</b>: in spite of worldwide acclaim, don’t come here for the cookie - stick to the icecream (if that's what you're into)
              <br>
              <b>La Colombe</b>: gluten free (if that matters), and sort of everywhere around the city. A little crunchier than most - for those who also like their fries crispy
              <br>
              <b>Alamo Drafthouse Cinema</b>: really cool, mainly because warm cookies were served to us in a theater as we were watching a movie, but also warm, dense, and fragrant
              <br>
              <b>Balthazar Bakery</b>: chewy, chocolatey and basically pleasant, but not exactly the city’s most memorable cookie
              <br>
              <b>Dō</b>: awesome cookies, well-rounded chewy texture and very chocolatey. unpopular opinion, but go for the cookie and not the dough
              <br>
              <b>By CHLOE</b>: these vegan cookies are larger than the size of an average human head and are sprinkled all over with chocolate, which is awesome, but just a little too crunchy and thin for my liking
            </p>
            <p class="sub1">Hanover, NH</p>
            <p class="description1">
              <b>FoCo (!!)</b>: objectively pretty awesome cookies, reminds me a lot of Insomnia but have eaten so many in a week that I almost had to take a FoCo cookie sabbatical once. Basically, dangerous but in a good way
              <br>
              <b>My Brigaderio</b>: these cookies are thick and slightly salty in such a good way. Best cookies in Hanover, which potentially doesn't say too much, but trust me these are phenomenal
              <br>
              <b>The Box Food Truck</b>: cookies with oatmeal sprinkled on top, which surprisingly works very well. Overall, a good purchase and snack but nothing too exciting
